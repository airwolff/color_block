# Color Block Picker that works!!!

- Clicking on start creates a random number that will tell you which block to click on, ooh, fancy.

- An array is iterated over that appends to DOM and gives a div an ID based on the index and a color based on the value of index.

- Listener checks against random number and div id to see if you're color blind, cause I'm not sure why else you wouldn't be correct.

- Hit start again, it's very addictive and exciting.
